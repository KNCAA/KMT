                    <p class="text anims" id="end">At the end of the Great Patriotic War, it was necessary to restore the
                        destroyed national economy. The country needed heavy industry specialists. By order of the
                        Minister of Oil and Gas Industry Baibakov N.K., the Kuban Oil Technical School is being created
                        in Tuapse.
                        Ilyas Hasanovich Adigezalov was appointed the first director of the college.
                        Already during the first two issues (1948-1949), 192 specialists received diplomas, who provided
                        significant assistance to the Kuban oilmen in restoring the destroyed oil industry. The first
                        graduates made a great contribution to the development of the oil and gas industry of the region
                        and the country.
                        By the decision of the Council of Ministers of the USSR in 1951, the Tuapse Oil College was
                        transferred to Krasnodar, to its historical center, where an academic building, a house for
                        teachers and two dormitories were built.
                        In 1952, Boris Grigorievich Holidays was appointed director of the Krasnodar Oil College.
                        In September 1958, by order of the Ministry of Construction of the RSFSR, the Krasnodar Oil
                        College was renamed the Krasnodar Assembly College. This required a radical restructuring and
                        re-equipment of the educational and material base. The evening department opens in the
                        specialties: "Planning of the oil and gas industry", "Drilling of oil and gas wells",
                        "Industrial and civil construction". At the full-time department, admission is carried out to
                        the specialties: "Installation and repair of industrial equipment", "Industrial and civil
                        construction", "Operation and repair of motor transport". The correspondence department of the
                        specialty opens: "Industrial and civil construction", "Electrical equipment of industrial
                        enterprises", "Construction and road machinery".
                        Krasnodar Assembly College in the period of the 60-70s had a teaching staff of 56 people and a
                        number of branches. The student body was 1814. At this time, a production base was created for
                        passing all production practices in educational and production workshops, a mechanical workshop,
                        a locksmith workshop for 30 jobs, an automatic welding workshop, a car maintenance workshop, a
                        laboratory for the resistance of materials and metal technology, a laboratory for testing
                        building materials, an electrical laboratory, a laboratory for electrical equipment of cars, in
                        a separate pavilion an electric arc welding workshop for 10 welding booths is equipped.
                        In the 70s, the college trained specialists for the installation of small-scale energy
                        facilities. This profession was mastered by students of the electrical department.
                        Political, educational and educational work in the 70s was carried out under the leadership of
                        youth public organizations of the Komsomol and the party organization of the technical school.
                        In March 1971, the collective celebrated its 25th anniversary. A capsule was laid in his honor,
                        opened in 1996, on the day of the 50th anniversary of the college.
                        In the 70-80 years, the training of specialists continued in 3 forms of training: full-time,
                        evening and correspondence. In December 1973 Dmitry Ivanovich Dyachenko was appointed director
                        of the technical school.
                        In 70-80, construction in the country developed intensively. Students of the Installation
                        College were in demand everywhere. The production practice took place at large enterprises in
                        the territory of the former republics of the USSR.
                        The end of the 80s - the beginning of the 90s is one of the most intense periods in the history
                        of the college. In 1984, Leonid Ivanovich Lyushin was appointed director of the Krasnodar
                        Assembly College by the Ministry of Installation and Special Construction Works of the USSR.
                        "Honored Builder of Russia", Veteran of labor.
                        In the difficult economic conditions of the 90s, the administration of the college was able to
                        find new ways to develop and strengthen the financial situation. Construction and installation
                        trusts and the administration of the Krasnodar Territory helped in the purchase of new equipment
                        and tools for workshops, offices and laboratories.
                        In 1996, the college solemnly celebrated its 50th anniversary. Currently, the Krasnodar Assembly
                        College is a popular and dynamically developing organization, the development of the college's
                        infrastructure, innovative teaching methods and a practice-oriented learning process ensure the
                        competitiveness of our graduates in the labor market of the Krasnodar Territory and the Russian
                        Federation.
                        From 1946 to the present, the lines from the poem written back in 1955 by graduate Yuri
                        Shchetinin are very relevant:</p>
